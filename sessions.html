    <h2 class="text-elt-blue fw-bold">1. Why Learning Feels Hard</h2>
    <p>
      Learning often feels hard not because the subject is too complex, but because the learner is emotionally blocked, mentally distracted, or disconnected from the purpose of study.
      At ELT, we teach that learning is not just about taking in information ‚Äî it‚Äôs about aligning the brain, the body, and the spirit. When your emotions are in charge, learning becomes a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many learners are stuck in emotional cycles ‚Äî stress, anxiety, self-doubt ‚Äî which drain their mental energy and make learning feel heavy. You‚Äôre not lazy. You‚Äôre simply emotionally locked down.
      This session helps you discover the internal causes of learning resistance, how to decode them, and how to begin rebuilding the right learning mindset.

<!-- Session 2 -->

    <h2 class="text-elt-blue fw-bold">2. The Power of Connection</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important concepts in the learning process is <strong>connection</strong>. Your brain learns best when it connects deeply with what you‚Äôre studying. But how do you create that connection?
      Through focus, understanding, and organization ‚Äî what we call the ‚ÄúConnection Triangle‚Äù at ELT.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your brain is emotionally distracted, overloaded with clutter, or disorganized, connection breaks. You may ‚Äúread‚Äù something, but it never really enters your system.
      This session teaches you how to build solid connections by understanding what your brain needs:
      mental space, clarity of purpose, and structured learning. You‚Äôll also learn how to connect learning to your dreams, values, and daily life for lasting memory and meaning.

<!-- Session 3 -->
<section id="session3" class="py-5 bg-light">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="text-elt-blue fw-bold">3. Emotional Lockdown vs Intentional Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional Lockdown happens when your feelings take over your learning life. You want to study ‚Äî but you feel tired, confused, anxious, or restless. You wait to ‚Äúfeel ready‚Äù before you start ‚Äî and you never start.
    </p>
    <p>
      ELT introduces the shift from <strong>emotional learning</strong> to <strong>intentional learning</strong>. Instead of depending on temporary motivation, we train you to build consistency through understanding, purpose, and discipline.
      In this session, you‚Äôll learn how to notice when you‚Äôre locked down emotionally, how to respond intentionally, and how to reclaim control of your learning journey. You‚Äôll also explore how small actions and consistency can override emotional cycles and lead to deep, lasting habits.
